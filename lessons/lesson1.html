                BCIT lab computers are re-imaged each day. Files you save on the
                local C: drive of a lab computer will be erased after the
                computer power is cycled.

                COMP 1950 homework assignments, quizzes, in class exercises and
                example code can be accessed via Desire 2 Learn (D2L). Use your
                BCIT student number and password to access D2L. Course materials
                will become avilable as the course progresses. It is your
                responsibility to log in and download files as they become
                available.

              <p>
                Each student will get a personal webspace where you will publish
                your homework assignments. This is not a continuation of your
                COMP1850 site (if you had one). This site is primarily for you
                to house your exercises, assignments and group work. Make it a
                site that is usable and functional.
              </p>
              <p>
                Use Filezilla, or any FTP client to connect to bcitcomp.ca. The
                bcitcomp.ca server provides you with a space on the internet
                where you can publish your homework and assignments. INSERT

                There are several development tools to choose from. In COMP 1950
                we will use the open source Integrated Devlopment Environment
                (IDE) from Microsoft called Visual Studio Code (VS Code). This
                is more than a simple text editor, it provides robust code
                editing, maintenance and testing features, as well as supporting
                plugins to further increase it's capabilities.

              <p>
                The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international
                community where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the
                public work together to develop Web standards. Led by Web
                inventor and Director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe,
                W3C's mission is to lead the Web to its full potential. Contact
                W3C for more information.
              </p>
              <p>
                The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded by Tim
                Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear
                Research (CERN) in October, 1994. It was founded at the
                Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer
                Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the European Commission and
                the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which had
                pioneered the ARPANET, one of the predecessors to the Internet

              <h1>Standards: File and Folder Naming</h1>
              <p>
                HTTP urls cannot contain certain characters, and certain
                characters will cause unwanted effects and behaviours when used
                in a url
              </p>

            <div>
              <h1>File Management</h1>
              <p>
                Including an index.html file in every folder on your server will
                ensure users cannot go snooping around your filesystem. the
                index.html file can be a blank HTML page if you like, as long as
                the user does not see a list of files when they request a folder
              </p>

              <h1>Standards: Code style and Organization</h1>
              <p>
                In COMP1950 students are expected to present a readable, well
                organized code style:
              </p>
              <img src="../images/css_commenting.png" alt="CSS Commenting" />
              <p>
                In HTML, use carriage return and tabs to indicate parent-child
                tag relationships. Likewise, code your CSS to make it easy to
                see which rules are applied to each selector.
              </p>
              <p>
                Separate different file types into folders. At minimum, keep all
                non-html files in their own folder. If you like you can make a
                dedicated 'html' folder for your .html files as well.

              <h1>Semantic Markup</h1>
              <p>
                When writing semantic markup, we use HTML tags to tell browsers
                something about the contents of the element. In semantic markup,
                tags are no longer just a way to get content to show up on a web
                page in a human-readable format. The tags themselves become a
                way to tell a machine (whether a browser, a computer, a
                smartphone, or another smart device) something about the meaning
                of the content. To write semantic markup, we must use HTML tags
                correctly so that our markup is both human-readable and
                machine-readable. Read more:
